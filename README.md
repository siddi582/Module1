# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: To gather insights on the most successful Kickstarter Campaigns and see where there is room for improvement

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- We can determine which campaigns are popular and least successful overall 
- The campaigns faced higher success during summer (May-June)
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- I can conclude that the success of the campaigns tends to be higher with more projects lined up. This is due to the goal being lower in the beginning but as targets rise so do the challenges in order to meet those targets
- It is also apparent that there are more kickstarters in later years. This could be due to the earlier success of the Kickstarters when first launched.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
The sample does not fully represent the population of Kickstarter campaigns. Also, there is limited data which makes it difficult to determine the performance of each industry or category/subcategory during specific periods. This would help us consider outside circumstances during our analysis. 
Having data on metrics for consumer preferanced such as which categories are successful would also improve our analysis as opposed as it will show the consumer trusts in the kickstarted campaign. 
Another factor that would make this dataset standout would be to have more information on the goal of each campaign as this will allow us to target campagins that are more affordable for the company.

## Results


4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1.	We can generate graphs for all metrics covered with and without "plays".
2.	Tables is another alternative as this would show successful categories/subcategories in comparison to unsuccessful ones along with detailed data supporting each category' success. This could be measured by looking at
a) success rate per category/subcategory b) median, max and min funding goal/target per category/subcategory, c) median, max and min of average donations, d) median, max, and mix of the percentage funded per category/subcategory, e) median, max, and min length of Kickstarter camapaigns timeline per category/subcategory. 
3.	Visualizations that show the length of time companies have to complete Kickstarter campaigns where the most successful and least successful campaigns are looked at, showing the measure of success when companies have more time to complete programs and achieve funding targets versus those that have less time.
4.	Graphs that organize each category into subcategories to determine an organization's success. This could be outlined by looking at broad categories like in donations or genre such as film. Breaking data such as this would allow us to better understand company' successes and where to generate the most funds.
5. Displays are another alternative to show this dataset, as this would help us outline significant outliers and allows us to see a wide variety of data.
